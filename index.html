        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>JavaScript is a Cross Platform, Object-Oriented scripting language.ti is a small and Lightweight language.Inside a host environment (for example,a web browser),JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to Provide Programmatic control over them.</h3>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>JavaScript contain a standard Library of objects, such as Array, Date , and Math, and a core set of Language elements such as operators , control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of Purpose by Supplementing it with additional Objects; for example:</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Client-Side JavaScript extends the Core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, Client-Side extensions <br>allow an application to place elements on an HTML from and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and Page navigation.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Server-Side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, Server-Side extensions allow an application <br>to communicate with a database, Provide continuity of information form one invocation to another of the application , or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>JavaScript and Java</h1>
    <br>
    <p>JavaScript and Java are Similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others.The Javascript language resembles Java but dose not have Java's static <br>representing numeric strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax,naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the <br> reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by Declarations,JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data type representing numeric,<br>Boolean, and string value. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model Provides <br> Dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inheried can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can <br>
    be properties of objects, executing as loosely type methods.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    JavaScript is a very free-from language compared to Java.You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and Methods.You do not have to be concerned with whether <br> Methods are Public , Private, or Protected,and you don not have to implement interfaces. Variables,Parameters and functions return types are not explicity typed.

   <div class="phone">
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello World" JavaScript code</p>
   </div>

   <div id="div4">
    function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " +yourName);}
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    greetMe("World");

    <p>Select the code in the Pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your Browser!</p>

    <h1>Variables</h1>
    <br>
    <p>You use variables as Symbolic names for values in your application The names of Variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules. <br> <br> A JavaScript identifiers must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); Subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase). <br><br>You can use ISO 8859 -1 or unicode letters such as a and u in identifiers. You can also use the unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers . some examples of legal names are numbers_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
